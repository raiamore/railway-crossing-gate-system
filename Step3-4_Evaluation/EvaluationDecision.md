# Steps 3 & 4 â€“ Evaluating Alternatives + Decision  

## Evaluation  

| Solution                  | Simplicity | Safety   | Reliability                          |  
|---------------------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|  
| **Direct Sensor Logic**   | High       | High     | Moderate (Single-sensor failure risk) |  
| **Sensor + Delay/Redundancy** | Moderate   | Very High | Very High                            |

## Decision  

I choose **Alternative 2 (Sensor + Delay/Redundancy)** because it offers the best balance between **safety** and **reliability**.  
While slightly more complex, redundancy reduces the risk of failure and the safety delay prevents premature gate lifting if a vehicle is still on the tracks.  

In a **safety-critical environment**, reliability outweighs minimal added complexity or cost.
