# Step 2: Exploring Alternatives  

## Research at Least One Real-World Example  

In **Australia**, active level crossings use **track circuits** to detect approaching trains.  
When train wheels shunt the rails, the system registers track occupancy and triggers **warning lights, alarms, and boom gates** (Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator [ONRSR], 2023).  

Modern systems such as the **Wireless Level Crossing (WLX)** incorporate **axle-counters** and **wireless communications**, powered by **solar panels with battery backup** to ensure continuous operation during outages (Rail Express, 2022).  

Many crossings also include **monitoring systems** such as **obstruction detection, CCTV, and fault reporting** to support safety compliance and remote maintenance (Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board [RISSB], 2019).
